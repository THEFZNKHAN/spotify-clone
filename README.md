This repository contains a Spotify Web App built using React. This app allows users to search for songs, artists, and albums on Spotify and play the selected tracks.

## Features

- Search for songs, artists, and albums on Spotify
- Play selected tracks
- View track information such as album cover, artist name, and song duration
- Control playback with play, pause, and skip buttons

## Installation

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-web-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd spotify-web-app`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Spotify API credentials:
   ```
   REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```
5. Start the development server: `npm start`
6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

Note: You will need to obtain your own Spotify API credentials by creating an application at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).

## Usage
